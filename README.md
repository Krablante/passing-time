## Philosophy

The core idea of this application is rooted in the stoic practice of **"Memento Mori"** ‚Äì "Remember you must die." It's not meant to be morbid, but rather to instill an appreciation for the present moment and the preciousness of time. By watching the seconds of the day tick away, we are gently nudged to live more intentionally.

The phrase **"Bello, non pace"** further emphasizes this. It suggests that life's meaning and growth are often found in struggle, challenge, and active engagement, rather than in passive tranquility.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Countdown:** Displays the hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until midnight.
*   **Minimalist Design:** A clean, distraction-free interface focusing solely on the passage of time.
*   **Responsive:** Adapts to various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
*   **Philosophical Touch:** Subtle reminders of "Memento Mori" and "Bello, non pace" to provoke thought.
*   **PWA Ready:** Includes a service worker for offline capabilities and can be "installed" on devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Service Worker:** For offline support and caching.
*   **Development/Build:** (This project appears to use esm.sh for direct browser imports, no local bundler like Vite is explicitly configured in the provided files. The `index.html` directly imports `.tsx` files via an import map.)

## üöÄ Getting Started (Development)

This project is set up to run directly in browsers that support ES modules and import maps, as seen in `index.html`.

1.  **Serve the files:**
    You'll need a simple HTTP server to serve the project files from the root directory. Many tools can do this, for example, using Node.js:
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```
    Or if you have Python installed:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser.

2.  **Cloning (if from a repository):**
    If you have this project in a Git repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd memento-mori-countdown
    ```
    Then serve the files as described above.

    There are no traditional `npm install` steps needed with the current setup, as dependencies like React are fetched directly via CDN (esm.sh).

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

*   Customizable themes or color schemes.
*   User-defined significant dates for countdowns (beyond just end-of-day).
*   Integration with a quotes API for daily philosophical insights.
*   Sound cues for hourly or significant countdown milestones.
*   More elaborate PWA features (e.g., notifications).

## üôè Acknowledgements

Inspired by the principles of Stoicism and the ever-relevant reminder to make the most of our time.
