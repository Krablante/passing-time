## Philosophy

The core idea of this application is rooted in the stoic practice of **"Memento Mori"** ‚Äì "Remember you must die." It's not meant to be morbid, but rather to instill an appreciation for the present moment and the preciousness of time. By watching the seconds of the day tick away, we are gently nudged to live more intentionally.

The phrase **"Bello, non pace"** further emphasizes this. It suggests that life's meaning and growth are often found in struggle, challenge, and active engagement, rather than in passive tranquility.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Countdown:** Displays the hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until midnight.
*   **Minimalist Design:** A clean, distraction-free interface focusing solely on the passage of time.
*   **Responsive:** Adapts to various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
*   **Philosophical Touch:** Subtle reminders of "Memento Mori" and "Bello, non pace" to provoke thought.
*   **PWA Ready:** Includes a service worker (from the `public` directory) for offline capabilities and can be "installed" on devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (React dependencies are referenced via CDN in `index.html` using an import map).
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (loaded via CDN in `index.html`).
*   **Development Server & Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
*   **Service Worker:** For Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities and offline support.
*   **Package Manager:** Assumes npm (or yarn/pnpm, based on your `package.json` and preferences).

## üöÄ Getting Started (Development)

This project uses Vite for its development server and build process.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd memento-mori-countdown # Or your project's directory name
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages defined in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (Or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` if you use a different package manager).

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Start the Vite development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (Or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`).
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser at a local address (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). Vite will handle the TypeScript compilation and serve the app with hot module replacement.

5.  **Build for Production:**
    To create a production-ready build:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    (Or `yarn build` or `pnpm build`).
    The optimized static assets will be generated in the `dist` directory (or as configured in `vite.config.ts`). These files are then ready for deployment to a static hosting service.

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements

*   Customizable themes or color schemes.
*   User-defined significant dates for countdowns (beyond just end-of-day).
*   Integration with a quotes API for daily philosophical insights.
*   Sound cues for hourly or significant countdown milestones.
*   More elaborate PWA features (e.g., notifications).

## üôè Acknowledgements

Inspired by the principles of Stoicism and the ever-relevant reminder to make the most of our time.
