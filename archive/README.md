**Dive into the abyss of time with "Reverse Clock" ‚Äî a web application that uniquely shows how much time is left until the new day, wrapped in an atmosphere of ancient mysteries and cosmic dread.**

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **‚è≥ Reverse Countdown:** Visually displays the hours and minutes remaining until midnight (in HH : MM format).
*   **‚ÜîÔ∏è Horizontal Clock Face:** A unique vintage-style horizontal dial with a moving hand, symbolizing the passage of the day from 00:00 to 23:59.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Hand:**
    *   Clicking the clock hand displays a panel with the **current system time** (HH : MM : SS), updated every second.
    *   A second click hides the panel.
*   **üìÖ Date Display:** Shows the current date in DD/TDM DayOfWeek format (where TDM is the total days in the month).
*   **üé® Atmospheric "Eldritch/Abyssal" Design:**
    *   A carefully selected color palette (`primordial-parchment`, `abyssal-stone`, `eldritch-bronze`) and fonts (`Cinzel Decorative`, `Old Standard TT`) create a dark and mysterious atmosphere.
    *   A dynamic background with "cosmic nebula" and "flickering campfire light" effects enhances immersion.
*   **üöÄ PWA (Progressive Web App):**
    *   Installable on devices.
    *   Offline functionality thanks to resource caching.
*   **üì± Responsive Design:** Displays correctly on various devices and screen sizes.
*   **‚ôø Accessibility:** Use of ARIA attributes to improve interaction with assistive technologies.

## üï∞Ô∏è How It Works

The application performs the following calculations every minute (for the countdown) and every second (for system time, if displayed):

1.  **Remaining Time:** The difference between the current time and midnight of the next day.
2.  **Hand Position:** The percentage of time elapsed since the beginning of the current day (00:00). The hand moves smoothly from left to right.
3.  **Current Date:** Formatting the current date for display.
4.  **System Time (on demand):** When the clock hand is clicked, an interval is started that updates the display of the current system time every second.

## üé® Aesthetics and Theme

The application's design is inspired by themes of ancient manuscripts, cosmic depths, and mysterious rituals. The "Eldritch/Abyssal" color scheme uses deep, rich tones of stone, parchment, and bronze, creating the feel of an ancient artifact. The `Cinzel Decorative` font for headings and `Old Standard TT` for body text emphasize the vintage and slightly mystical character. The animated background adds dynamism and depth to the visual experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (configured via CDN with a custom theme)
*   **Build and PWA:** Vite (with the `vite-plugin-pwa` plugin)
*   **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Cinzel Decorative, Old Standard TT)
